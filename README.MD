# UFC AI Fight Simulator

This repository contains an MMA/UFC fight simulator where AI agents make strategic decisions based on fighter attributes, probabilistic models, and stochastic game search algorithms.

---

## üöÄ Overview

The **UFC AI Fight Simulator** allows simulating bouts between agents programmed with different strategies, ranging from simple rule-based approaches to advanced search and reinforcement learning algorithms. Virtual fighters have attribute profiles (strength, accuracy, stamina, etc.) and choose strikes and defenses based on probability distributions, MDP/POMDP policies, Expectimax, and MCTS.

## üéØ Key Features

- Fighter modeling with real attributes and performance history.
- Discrete-event simulation environment (rounds and time-steps) with stochastic events.
- Action selection via:
  - Heuristic rule-based agents (sense‚Äìthink‚Äìact).
  - Expectimax with chance nodes (stochastic games).
  - Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS).
- Integration of ML models:
  - Classification/regression to predict strike success rates (Scikit-Learn).
  - Reinforcement Learning (Q-Learning or DQN) to optimize policies through self-play.
- Collection and analysis of metrics: win rate, average damage, number of rounds.
- Automated tournaments between different agents for strategy comparison.
